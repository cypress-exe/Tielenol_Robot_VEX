# VEX Push Back Robot Code

This repository contains the code for our VEX V5 robot designed for the VEX Push Back game. Although the code is specifically designed for our robot's configuration and competition strategy, others are welcome to view and be inspired by the code, although direct use is disallowed until after May 31st, 2026. 

## Overview

This is a monolithic Python program built for VEX V5 that includes:

- **Custom Logging System**: Paginated logging to brain and controller screens with multiple log levels - particularly useful for debugging and real-time monitoring.
- **Holonomic Drivetrain Control**: Support for forward/backward, strafing, and turning movements.
- **Intake System**: Automated complex intake configurations.
- **Competition Compatibility**: Autonomous and driver control modes
- **Configurable Settings**: Centralized settings and robot configuration classes.

## Robot Configuration

- **Drivetrain**: 4-motor drive system with independent strafe wheel
- **Intake**: 4-motor complex intake system. (Hard to explain).
- **Sensors**: Inertial & color sensor

## Prerequisites

- VEX V5 Brain and compatible hardware
- Python with `vex` module
- VEX V5 VSCode Extension for development and deployment

## Attribution

Because this is a competition, you may not use our code to gain a possible competitive advantage over us. Because competition ends by May 31st, 2026, you may use this code with attribution after that date.

If you use any portions of this code in your own projects, you must:

1. **Ensure the date is past May 31st, 2026** 
2. **Credit the original team**: \<Team Name>, \<Number>
